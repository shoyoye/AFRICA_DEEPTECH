    "stoichiometry": {
      "explanation": "Stoichiometry is the study of the relationship between the amounts of reactants and products in a chemical reaction.",
      "explanation_alt": "Imagine you're cooking. Stoichiometry is like following a recipe — the right amount of ingredients gives you the correct meal (product)."

    "acids_and_bases": {
      "explanation": "Acids turn blue litmus paper red, have a sour taste, and pH less than 7. Bases turn red litmus blue and feel slippery.",
      "explanation_alt": "Acids are like lemon juice — sour and sharp. Bases are like soap — bitter and slippery."

    "periodic_table": {
      "explanation": "The periodic table organizes elements based on their atomic number, groups, and periods.",
      "explanation_alt": "Think of the periodic table as an element family chart. Elements in the same group behave in similar ways."

  "physics": {
    "motion": {
      "explanation": "Motion is a change in position of an object over time, described using speed, velocity, and acceleration.",
      "explanation_alt": "If something moves from one place to another, it's in motion — like a car driving or a ball rolling."
    },
    "electricity": {
      "explanation": "Electricity is the flow of electric charge through a conductor, driven by voltage and resisted by resistance.",
      "explanation_alt": "Electricity is like water flowing through a pipe. Voltage is the push, current is the flow, and resistance is like a blockage."
    },
    "work_and_energy": {
      "explanation": "Work is done when a force moves an object. Energy is the ability to do work.",
      "explanation_alt": "When you lift something heavy, you’re using energy to do work — that’s how they’re connected."

  "biology": {
    "photosynthesis": {
      "explanation": "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants make their own food using sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide.",
      "explanation_alt": "Plants use sunlight like humans use a stove — to cook their food from water and air."
    },
    "respiration": {
      "explanation": "Respiration is how organisms break down food to release energy, using oxygen (aerobic) or not (anaerobic).",
      "explanation_alt": "It’s like charging a phone. Respiration gives cells the energy they need to work."
    },
    "digestive_system": {
      "explanation": "The digestive system breaks down food into nutrients the body can absorb and use.",
      "explanation_alt": "It’s like a blender + filter: your stomach blends the food, your intestines absorb the good stuff."

  "mathematics": {
    "algebra": {
      "explanation": "Algebra is a branch of mathematics that uses symbols to represent unknown values and solve equations.",
      "explanation_alt": "Algebra is like solving a mystery: 'x' is the missing value you're trying to find."
    },
    "trigonometry": {
      "explanation": "Trigonometry studies the relationship between angles and sides of triangles, using sine, cosine, and tangent.",
      "explanation_alt": "In a right triangle, trigonometry helps you find unknown angles or lengths — like a measuring tool."
    },
    "mensuration": {
      "explanation": "Mensuration deals with measuring the area, volume, and perimeter of shapes and solids.",
      "explanation_alt": "Mensuration is about knowing how big or small something is — like the area of a room or volume of water in a bucket."
